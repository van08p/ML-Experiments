House Price Prediction
House price prediction is a common application of linear regression in real estate and finance. 
It involves predicting the price of a house based on its characteristics or features. 
Linear regression is chosen for this task because it can model the relationship between the input features (independent variables) 
and the house price (dependent variable) in a straightforward manner.
